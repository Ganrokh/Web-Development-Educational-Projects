# Web-Development-Educational-Projects
Projects showing understanding of web development.
I started learning programming with web development. While I learned a lot, I grew to not enjoy frontend development because I don't enjoy working with CSS.
I don't feel like a visually creative person. That said, I did enjoy working with Vue very much, more than React.
Python is my development language of choice right now. I may pursue backend development with Python and Go in the future.
